    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
    Here is a list of some of my most recent projects.
    <ul>
      <li>
        This first project is called Pet-webpage.  It showcases some simple HTML and CSS. This page celebrates our neighbor's cat. His name is Fries.

      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        This next project was a fun group project called Animal-Shelter.  We used HTML and CSS on this as well. We built this webpage in the VsCode text editor.  We were putting our new knowledge of building rows and columns to use.

        Lastly, I worked on another collaborative project called Cupcake-Shop. We also used HTMl and CSS.  We were running with some newly learned styles like Flashy.
